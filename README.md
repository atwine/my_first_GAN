# First Generative Adverserial Netwok

Today I am jumping into the big leagues: I have been learing about GANs from @sirajRaval 
I am still a novice at this and that is why I want to try out the first implementation so that I can get used to the concept of working with this information.

I am using the MNIST dataset on fashion: [here] (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

I hope when you go through the same process as I did in my notebook you will get some ideas on how to work with this kind of neural net.

Good Luck!
